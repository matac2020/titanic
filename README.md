# Titanic Kaggle Competition

This work is made by using Kaggle's famous, beginner friendly Titanic dataset.

The goal is to predict passengers' mortality after the iceberg crash.

There are 4 files in the repository:

1- train.csv : Includes all the features and the target. We use this file to predict passengers in test.csv
2- test.csv : Includes passengers which we are going to predict their survival after the crash and submit to kaggle. 
3- gender_submission.csv: which is an example file shows us how the submission file should be formatted before submitting to Kaggle.
4- Result.jpynb: is the file includes all the data science work made to predict survival of the passengers in test.csv.
